A simple request:

	ab -n 100 -c 10 http://www.yahoo.com/
	
Multiple requests can be stuck in a shell script:

	#!/bin/bash
	ab -n 100 -c 10 http://www.yahoo.com/ &
	ab -n 100 -c 10 http://www.google.com/
	
AB is typically used for load testing and benchmarking a website. This requires hitting it will multiple concurrent requests, often from multiple machines, to find out when the requests will top out.

You don't want to bring down the live server (which may be configured to prevent multiple requests rendering your test useless) so this should be done on a development server.

The load testing should be run from a different machine, rather than the server you're testing.
