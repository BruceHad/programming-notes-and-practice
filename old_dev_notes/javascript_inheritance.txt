## Class Inheritance

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain

Javascript doesn't have traditional class model for OO. It does support extending and inheritance via the prototype chain.

Only functional objects, those Contructor objects that take the form given below, have a predefined prototype object that you can access. If you create a new object from a constructor, it has a hidden [[prototype]] object that can't be accessed directly.

    function FuncObject(){
    ...
    }
    myObject = new FuncObject();
    // FuncObject.prototype
    // myObject.[[prototype]]

You can access the prototype using the dot notation.

    FuncObject.prototype.name = "Functional Object Name";
