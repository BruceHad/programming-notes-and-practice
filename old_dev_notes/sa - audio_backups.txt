Configuration file saved to C Drive.

Ripping:

1. CUE Sheet

A CUE sheet allows to burn a CD with exactly the same track/pause structure as the original CD (more info in Appendix). To create a CUE sheet, click Action | Create CUE sheet | Multiple WAVs with gaps (noncompliant). You will see that EAC detects the gaps, just like on the previous page. Like all other files, the CUE sheet is saved here.

2. Test & Copy

Choose Action | Test & Copy selected tracks | Compressed. Now EAC starts ripping. That will take about 10 to 60 minutes, depending on CD surface state, drive speed and Drive Options.

3. Two Checks

    1. When EAC has finished ripping, it will show a report (log). 'No errors occured' means the rip is perfect, 'There were errors' means some tracks couldn't be ripped properly.
    
    2. Look at the CRC checksums here. All tracks should say OK. If you see a # EAC has failed for that track. This additional check is needed because # do not generate a There were errors message!
