# PHP - Cribsheet

## File Handling

fopen() binds a named resource, specified by filename, to a stream. 

    resource fopen ( 
        string $filename , 
        string $mode [, bool $use_include_path = false [, resource $context ]] )


For example:

    $file = fopen("c:\\folder\\resource.txt", "r");

Mode indicates the reading mode to open the file in. For example "r" opens the file for reading, and places the cursor at start of file.

The optional third use_include_path parameter can be set to '1' or TRUE if you want to search for the file in the include_path (a list of standard directories that PHP will look in to find files), too.

## Strings 

### Quote and Escape Characters

Single quoted strings will display things almost completely "as is." Variables and most escape sequences will not be interpreted. The exception is that to display a literal single quote, you can escape it with a back slash \', and to display a back slash, you can escape it with another backslash \\ (So yes, even single quoted strings are parsed).

Double quote strings will display a host of escaped characters and variables in the strings will be evaluated. An important point here is that you can use curly braces {} to isolate the name of the variable you want evaluated.

Heredoc string syntax works like double quoted strings. It starts with <<<. After this operator, an identifier is provided, then a newline. The string itself follows, and then the same identifier again to close the quotation. You don't need to escape quotes in this syntax.

Nowdoc (since PHP 5.3.0) string syntax works essentially like single quoted strings. The difference is that not even single quotes or backslashes have to be escaped. A nowdoc is identified with the same <<< sequence used for heredocs, but the identifier which follows is enclosed in single quotes, e.g. <<<'EOT'. No parsing is done in nowdoc.
