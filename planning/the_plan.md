# Learn To Program

Start off with Javascript and Python. 

JS is the main language for web applications. That makes it easy to learn because there are plenty of resources and it works anywhere there is a browser. Even code analysis and debugging is getting easier with tools built into every browser. Javascript frameworks are popular at the moment. AngularJS seems a good place to start. It a big framework, highly opinionated and under rapid development. It's seems to be a good fit as I can program in normal javascript while having the restrictions and guidance of the framework. Backbone is apparently lighter and more flexible. Would be a good tool to know about as well. Should also probably get comfortable with JQuery, since it is so popular.

For backend web development, my limited PHP knowledge and a bit of SQL should be enough to get by initially. Would be good to learn node.js and how to use python on a web server too. 

Python seems to be a good, general purpose programming language. This will be good for me learning the principles of computer science - algorithms, analysis, testing, de-bugging.
