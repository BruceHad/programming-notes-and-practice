**Bordom and drudgery are evil.**

Not just bad, or annoying. Evil. It is useful attitude, it weakens the whole _work ethic_ meme that makes people ashamed of not doing 'productive' (i.e. paid) work, and immensely proud of doing well paid but useless jobs.

My plans kinda started with ERS's [How to Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.htm). Re-reading it now is enlightening. One of the very earliest paragraphs hit me (emphasis mine).

> [T]o be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.
>
>If you aren't the kind of person that feels this way naturally, **you'll need to become one in order to make it as a hacker**. Otherwise you'll find your hacking energy is sapped by distractions like sex, money, and social approval.
>
>(You also have to **develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity**)

A tip for achieving this level of dedication is found further down. 

> Being something of a social outcast helps you stay concentrated on the really important things, like thinking and hacking.

Recently found a file dated 15/04/2010 documenting a nascent plan to become a programmer. It even laments the numerous, previous attempts and false starts and plans that had fallen by the wayside.

It's a bit depressing. Here I am again, four years and two days later, with nothing to show for it. I say nothing, but progress has been made. But not enough, and not fast enough.
